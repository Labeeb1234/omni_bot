- **Dynamic Obstacle avoidance w/ DWB local controller/planner** (updated simulations)

- **Dynamic Obstacle avoidance w/ MPPI local controller/planner** (updated simulations)
  
The environment used for this simulation was a modified version of a small warehouse asset preset in the NVIDIA Omniverse Database. Few changes were made to the environment to make it suitable for our purpose. (pic given below)

  - senario-1 (static obstacles mapped)

  - senario-2 (unmmaped static obstacles)

  - senario-3 (just one unmapped dynamic obstacle)
  - senario-4 (more unmapped moving obstacles)
